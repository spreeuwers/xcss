        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <a href="https://github.com/spreeuwers/xcss">XCSS</a>
        It is an experimental framework for web development using css style rules and plain js.
        Since there are only a few hundred js frameworks I thought it was about time to introduce yet another one.
        I think all programmers should create their own frame work! ;)
        <br>
        Since I dont like installing tools and libraries my starting point was that just adding the xcss.js script
        to a web page should be enough to enable the framework and add the new css functionality.
        No extra tools for building should be needed.<br>
        Unlike powerfull frameworks like AngularJS and React my framework should be super simple to use
        and require no tools to get started.<br>


        <p>

        <a name="extends"><h3>Extends</h3></a>
        XCSS.js emerged from an experiment to implement the <b>extends</b> keyword for css
        using a js library that manipulates css rules.
        Since I did not want to use SASS, I thought, I would give it a try and
        make it possible to write the following syntax:

<pre>

    red-button {
      background-color:red;
    }

    red-green-button extends red-button {
       border:2px solid green;
    }

</pre>
        Because the <b>extends</b> keyword is meaningless in a css selector
        unless you would create an element by that name,
        introducing this keyword would have no impact on page rendering.<br>
        Then I contemplated that CSS rules act on selections of elements and that expressing the logic with css rules
        whould be a powerfull way to implement functionality in web pages.
        And I looked for other extensions that I could add to CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            I discovered that I could use the content property in css rules to implement a templating mechanism.
            Allowing the content property value to be a javascript expression created a way to pull content in from js modules .
            Therfore I added CORS security, only allowing same origin css files to be interpreted.
<pre>

    div[string-content] {
      content:"'&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;'"
    }

    div[js-content] {
      content:"document.getElementById('page1).innerHTML";
    }

    div[url-content] {
      content:url(page2.html)
    }

</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        Then I thought of a way to do routing in css. By introducing the ONCLICK and more ON event keywords that allowed
        adding event listeners to elements that changed the location hash and a WHEN keyword than applied a style depending on the location hash,
        i created a simple routing mechanism.

<pre>

    button ONCLICK showpage2 {
    }

    div WHEN showpage2 {
      content:url(page2.html)
    }

    div WHEN * astate [myvar="myModule.myfunc()"]{
        color:var(--myvar);
    }

</pre>
