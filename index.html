        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <a href="https://github.com/spreeuwers/xcss">XCSS</a>
        It is an experimental framework for web development using css style rules and plain js.
        Since there are only a few hundred js frameworks i thought it was about time to introduce yet another one.
        <br>
        Since i hate installing tools and libraries (i am the worst admin) my starting point was that just adding the xcss.js script
        to a web page should be enough to enable the framework and add the new css functionality provided.
        No extra tools for building should be needed.<br>
        Unlike powerfull frameworks like AngularJS and React my framework should be super simple to use
        and require no other tools to build an app.<br>


        <p>
        XCSS.js emerged from an experiment to implement the <b>extends</b> keyword for css
        using a js library that manipulates css rules.
        Since i am too lazy to learn  sass, i thought i would give it a try and
        make it possible to write the following syntax:

<pre>

    red-button {
      background-color:red;
    }

    red-green-button extends dialog{
       border:2px solid green;
    }

</pre>
        The <b>extends</b> keyword means nothing in a css selector
        unless you would create an element by that name. It would have no impact on page rendering.
        Since all css rules act on selections of elements, expressing the logic with css rules
        should be a powerfull way to implement functionality in web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step was that i realised that i could use the content property in css rules to allow templating.
<pre>

    div[string-content] {
      content:"'&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;'"
    }

    div[url-content] {
      content:url(page2.html)
    }

</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        Then i thought of a way to do routing in css. By introducing the ONCLICK and more ON event keywords that allowed
        adding event listeners to elements that changed the location hash and a WHEN keyword than applied a style depending on the location hash,
        i created a simple routing mechanism.

<pre>

    button ONCLICK showpage2 {
    }

    div WHEN showpage2 {
      content:url(page2.html)
    }

</pre>
