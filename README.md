"# xcss"

A simple solution for inheriting classes
solves the problem of not having CSS variables
by extending classes

this scripts itrates through all css rules and detects
rules that have extents in their selector.

A new rule is added for these extends rules
with the self csstext and the inherited csstest

saves a lot of sass stuff
